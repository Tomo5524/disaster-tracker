# React Natural Disaster Tracker

## [Live](https://tomo5524.github.io/disaster-tracker/)

A React Web Application created to track realtime wildfires around the globe using NASA's Open API. The map data has been fetched from the Mapbox GL JS API, I also used font-awesome icon pack for fire and volcano icons.
